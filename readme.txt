== Credits ==

The plugin *MiniBB News* is based on the code that Paul Puzyrev, (http://minibb.net) wrote for the script *addon_1stPageNews2* which is an add-on for displaying news feed taken from miniBB forums engine on the first page of a website. I did nothing but modify it's code to make it work at the sidebar of wordpress and set options through the control panel.

== KEEP IN MIND ==

This plugin is tested in my installation only. That means you must better test it before you use it even though it doesn't seem to interfere with other plugins. As far as i know it is compatible with all the plugins i use and you could check mines at my plugins page. But i recommend that you deactivate any plugins that do a similar job aiming the same purpose. As we all know, BACKUP AND TRY IT BEFORE YOU USE IT! You are the only responsible person for your DATA.
